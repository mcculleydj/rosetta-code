# Partition

Write method to generate a partitioned linked list from an input list and value such that all elements greater than or equal to the value appear after elements that are less than the value. Ordering does not matter, e.g. 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 with a supplied value of 5 outputs 3 -> 1 -> -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8 where the partition exists between 2 and 10.
