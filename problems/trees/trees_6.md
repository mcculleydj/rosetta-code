# First Common Ancestor

Given two nodes in a binary tree and a reference to the root node find the first common ancestor of the two nodes without the use of state external to the tree itself (e.g. a data structure holding a collection of nodes). Assume that the nods appear in the tree, are unique to each other and the root.
